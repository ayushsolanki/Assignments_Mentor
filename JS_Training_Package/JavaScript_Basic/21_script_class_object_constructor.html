			// JavaScript uses functions as classes. 
			// Defining a class is as easy as defining a function.
			function Person() { 
				alert('Person instantiated');
			}
			
			// The Object (Class instance)
			// To create a new instance of an object we use the statement "new" 
			var person1 = new Person();
			var person2 = new Person();
			
			// Constructor
			/*
			The constructor is called at the moment of instantiation (the moment when the object instance is created). 
			The constructor is a method of the class. 
			In JavaScript, the function serves as the constructor; 
			There is no need to explicitly define a constructor method. 
			Every action declared in the class gets executed at the time of instantiation.
