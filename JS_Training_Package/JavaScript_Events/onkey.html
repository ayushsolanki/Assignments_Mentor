			In order to understand the difference between keydown and keypress, 
			it is useful to understand the difference between a "character" and a "key". A "key" is a physical button on 
			the computer's keyboard while a "character" is a symbol typed by pressing a button.  
			In theory, the keydown and keyup events represent keys being pressed or released, 
			while the keypress event represents a character being typed. 
			The implementation of the theory is not same in all browsers.
